The research finds that on short time scales, the relative phase exhibits 'light cone' dynamics, creating a metastable superfluid state. This phenomenon, which suppresses vortex proliferation, is identified as a reverse-Kibble-Zurek effect. The study uses both numerical methods (truncated Wigner approximation) and an analytical time-dependent renormalization group approach (RG) to analyze the relaxation of the supercritical state to a disordered state via dynamical vortex unbinding. The RG approach suggests a non-equilibrium Kosterlitz-Thouless type phase transition.",

The paper also reports a swap in the spatial distributions of two occupied and two empty subbands close to the Fermi level under different strains. The tunable gap width is shown to narrow as the width of the AGNRs increases.

    "longDesc": "This theoretical paper, conducted at the **B3LYP level of theory**, predicts that **half-metallicity** can be induced in a **zigzag edge graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR)** by applying an **external electric field** across the ribbon. Key findings show that the **critical electric field** required to realize half-metallicity decreases as the ribbon's width increases. The research also reveals that under very strong electric fields, the spin polarization and half-metallicity are removed when the edge state electrons fully transfer from one side to the other. Conversely, the useful electric field range for which the ZGNR remains half-metallic increases with the ribbon width. This rich field-induced **spin polarization** behavior suggests important applications in the field of **spintronics**.",

The authors show that for p > 1, contractivity generally holds if and only if the map is **unital**. When the domain is restricted to the traceless subspace of Hermitian matrices, contractivity is shown to hold for **qubits** for arbitrary $p \\geq 1$ and for **qutrits** if and only if $p=1$ or $p=\\infty$. In all cases where the map is non-contractive, the paper derives the best possible bounds on the p-norms.",
